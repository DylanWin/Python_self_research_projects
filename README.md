# Python_self_research_projects (Project 2)

Motive of this project is to:

1) Extract latest stock data from alpha_vantage API and apply technical indicators to observe stock trends, also observing and intepreting plots of technical indicator of stock during market open/close period

2) Understand basic framework of zipline algo-trading and return outputs from the zipline algo-trading function, and finally interpreting the performance of simple trade strategy (buying stock daily, .dual moving average crossover, Aroon). Also, a special section is added at the end to analyze trading startegy performance of airline stock that is affected by coronavirus issue.

Note: Reason to using alpha_vantage API as source of stock data is that Quandl requires subscription for latest data whereas alpha_vantage provides free access to latest data with the only limitation of 5 API request per minute(which is sufficient for student use, therefore suitable).
