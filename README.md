# Python_self_research_projects (Project 1)

Motive of this project is to :

1) Observe properties of different stocks from same/different sectors (histogram, qqplot, 95% CI width) 
2) Prove weak stationarity of the stocks (mean, variance of mean and variance of diffrent intervals and ACF correlogram)
3) Use technical indicators on stocks to determine technical indicator suitability for implementation on the particular stock and particular time period(short/long term), stock trends implied by technical indicator, and also determining shortfalls of technical indicators if any.
